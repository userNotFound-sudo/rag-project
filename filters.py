# filters.py
# ----------
# This file handles filtering and graceful failure in our RAG app.
#
# The retrieval problem:
# ChromaDB always returns results — even when nothing is relevant.
# If you ask "What is the best pizza topping?", ChromaDB will still return
# the 3 "most similar" tech documents, even though none of them actually
# match. Without filtering, we'd generate a nonsense answer from unrelated docs.
#
# The solution: similarity thresholds.
# We only keep documents where the distance (dissimilarity) is below a
# cutoff value. Documents that are too far away get dropped.
#
# Graceful degradation:
# When no documents pass the filter, we don't crash — we return a helpful
# message explaining what happened. This is called "graceful degradation."

def filter_by_threshold(documents, distances, threshold=SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD):
    """
    Keep only documents that are similar enough to the query.

    Args:
        documents:  List of document strings from ChromaDB.
        distances:  List of L2 distance values (one per document).
        threshold:  Max allowed distance. Documents with distance above
                    this are considered too dissimilar to be useful.

    # --- The RAG concept ---
    # This is where we enforce quality control on our retrieved context.
    # A document with distance 0.3 is very similar to the query — keep it.
    # A document with distance 1.8 is barely related — discard it.
    # If we passed irrelevant documents to the LLM, it might hallucinate
    # or give a confused answer. Filtering keeps the context clean.
    #
    # Steps:
    #   1. Create two empty lists: filtered_docs and filtered_distances
    #   2. Loop through documents and distances together using zip()
    #   3. For each (doc, distance) pair: if distance <= threshold, keep both
    #   4. Return (filtered_docs, filtered_distances)
    #
    return documents, distances  # placeholder — returns everything unfiltered
