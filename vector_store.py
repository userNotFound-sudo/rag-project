# vector_store.py
# ---------------
# This file manages our vector database using ChromaDB.
#
# Why do we store vectors in a database?
# When we embed all our documents, we get hundreds of vectors. We need a
# fast way to find which vectors are most similar to a query vector.
# A vector database is optimized for exactly this — it can search through
# thousands (or millions) of vectors in milliseconds using clever math.
#
# ChromaDB is an open-source vector database that runs locally,
# so we don't need to set up any servers or pay for cloud services.

import chromadb
from config import COLLECTION_NAME

# Create a ChromaDB client that stores data in memory.
# This means the data is cleared when the app restarts, but our app
# reloads the documents on startup automatically, so this works fine.

    Find the most similar documents to a given query embedding.

    ChromaDB compares the query vector against all stored vectors and
    returns the closest matches. "Closest" means smallest L2 distance,
    which corresponds to highest semantic similarity.

        query_embedding: The embedding vector for the user's query.
        n_results:       How many similar documents to return.

    Returns:
        A dictionary with keys "documents", "distances", and "ids".
        Each value is a list of lists (one inner list per query submitted).
        We only submit one query at a time, so we'll access index [0].
