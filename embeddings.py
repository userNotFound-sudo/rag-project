# embeddings.py
# -------------
# This file handles converting text into embeddings (vectors).
#
# What is an embedding?
# An embedding is a list of numbers (a vector) that represents the
# meaning of a piece of text. Similar texts produce similar vectors,
# which is what makes semantic search possible.
#
# For example:
#   "Python is a programming language" → [0.12, -0.34, 0.87, ...]
#   "Python helps you write code"      → [0.11, -0.35, 0.85, ...]  (very similar!)
#   "I love pizza"                     → [-0.72, 0.54, -0.12, ...]  (very different!)

# want to reload it every time we call embed_text().

    Convert a list of documents into a list of embeddings.

    This is more efficient than calling embed_text() in a loop because
    SentenceTransformer can process multiple documents at the same time.

    Returns:
        A list of embedding vectors (a list of lists of floats).
