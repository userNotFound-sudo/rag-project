# conversation.py
# ---------------
# This file manages conversation history for our RAG app.
#
# Why do we need conversation history?
# LLMs have no memory between API calls — each call starts completely fresh.
# Without history, if you ask "What is Python?" and follow up with
# "Can you give me an example?", the AI has no idea what "it" refers to.
#
# The solution: before each API call, we paste the recent conversation
# directly into the prompt. The LLM "remembers" because we tell it what
# was said before. This is called "in-context memory."

        #      (Each "turn" = 1 user message + 1 assistant reply = 2 items)

        #   2. For each message in recent, build a line:
        #      - If message["role"] == "user"      → "User: {message['content']}"
        #      - If message["role"] == "assistant"  → "Assistant: {message['content']}"
